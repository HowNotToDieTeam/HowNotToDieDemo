# Project Name

## **Description**

**How Not To Die** is a full-stack, collaborative storytelling game disguised as a survival console for interstellar explorers. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, the app is designed to showcase real-time user interactivity, clean UI/UX, and narrative-driven data flow within a stylized space-console interface.

Players assume the role of deep-space explorers sent to document the conditions of unknown planets. Each player contributes to a shared mystery by writing detailed explorer logs—some humorous, some harrowing, and some that hint at something far more ominous beneath the surface.

Users can:

- Explore planets and uncover immersive, interactive landscapes
- Write personal logs and submit public entries for review
- Read logs submitted by others and vote on which should be added to the official Survival Guide
- Interact with a galaxy map and travel via shuttle to discover new worlds
- Use malfunctioning tools like a “weather scanner” that pulls real Earth data as if it were planetary weather
- Experience unexpected system failures, hidden transmissions, and narrative surprises as they piece together clues

At its core, How Not To Die is a collaborative mystery game. Players work together to build the lore, expand the survival guide, and slowly uncover the truth behind strange signals, vanishing explorers, and the increasingly unstable AI known as VERA. Every log shapes the world, every vote builds the canon, and every clue brings players closer to the central mystery.

Deployed via Render and styled with responsive, atmospheric detail, How Not To Die invites you not just to survive, but to contribute to the mythos of those who do.
